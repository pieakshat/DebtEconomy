I have been thinking about an economic system that can also use debts as a means of exchange.  
The initial idea is that whenever a sender has insufficient funds a debt of the amount he wants to transfer will be created.
"It is different from the credit system as in a credit system there is the problem of trust in this system the debt will be created out of thin air with no interest payments."

I need to put some restrictions on how much debt an account can create. 
each account will have some balance i.e. the actual currency and debts linked to it. 

debts will be like individual tokens each debt will have three things: 
1. debtid: fingerprint of a debt.
2 account: account id linked to the debt.
3. amount: what amount that debt is worth.

The idea is like this "Bob provides a service to Alice now Alice will take some debt from Bob". 

I still have to figure out how the whole debt dynamic will work. I am thinking like there should be a limited number of debts in an economy and the debts can be added.
